# WebCrypt

WebCrypt is a browser-based encryption toolkit that combines modern AES-256 file encryption with classic ciphers. It includes a drag-and-drop interface for file encryption/decryption and emphasizes data privacy, encryption standards, and secure key handling.

## Features

- AES-256 file encryption and decryption.
- Real-time updates on delivery status and payment confirmations.
- Classic ciphers: Vigenere, Vernam, Hill, and Playfair.
- Drag-and-drop file encryption interface.
- Focus on data privacy, encryption standards, and secure key handling.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- HTML5 for structure and layout.
- CSS3 with Dark Mode for readability and professional appearance.
- Bootstrap for responsive design across devices.

### Backend

- JavaScript (ES6) for client-side logic and cipher implementations.
- File System (fs) for local encryption/decryption of uploaded files.

## Getting Started

1. Open the project folder in a browser by launching [index.html](index.html).
2. Choose a cipher from the interface.
3. Use the drag-and-drop area to encrypt or decrypt files.

## Notes

- This project runs locally in the browser; no server is required.
- Keep encryption keys private and avoid sharing them in plain text.
